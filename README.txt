What does this program do?

	It's a small script that resizes all images in a given folder and changes their filenames in a random manner. Suggested use of this program is evading image blocks/duplicate filter on imageboards.

How do I use it?

	1. Download .jar file from .\out\artifacts\imageRandomizer_jar and the configuration file, if you want to
	2. Put said .jar file in any folder and populate it with images that you want to edit (Make sure to use copies!)
	2.1 (optional) adjust settings in .properties file as you see fit. BOUND settings affect whether resizing direction will be random or program will try to decrease/increase resolution
	3. Run .jar file
